# String Similarity Demo
This application demonstrates the usage of [string metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_metric) components. More specifically the [Jaro-Winkler distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance) algorithm to find similarities of two texts. This app uses a [StringSimilarity.NET](https://github.com/feature23/StringSimilarity.NET) library for demonstration purposes, however you can find fully implemented libraries for most known programming languages. For example you can find a working implementation of a string metrics algorithm for TSQL ([example](https://gist.github.com/paulirwin/dcfa49700fb7b290705007ca37d66494)).

This app is programmed using Visual Studio and C#.
